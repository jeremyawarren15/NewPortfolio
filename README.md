## Synopsis
This is my personal portfolio website. I have it deployed through [Github Pages](https://jeremyawarren15.github.io/Portfolio/) so that anyone can see it. I go into a little bit of information about myself and my skills as well as some projects that I have been working on. If you have any questions about me, this project, or any of my other projects please contact me at jeremyawarren15@gmail.com.

## Motivation
This portfolio is a work in progress for me. I wanted to do some cool things with bootstrap and improve my design skills. I have learned a lot throughout this project and I hope that you like it.

## Design

[Here](https://coolors.co/114b5f-1a936f-88d498-c6dabf-f3e9d2) is a link to the color scheme that I used for this project. I wanted to focus on natural tones while keeping the spread of tones even so that the color scheme would have more contrast.

I used Quicksand and Lato for my fonts. [Here](https://fonts.google.com/selection?query=quicksand&selection.family=Lato|Quicksand) is a link to the fonts on Google Fonts. I thought that the combination of these fonts gave off an inviting feel and that was the main motivation for my choosing these two. I also wanted to keep it simple by using Google Fonts. Seriously, it's pretty awesome.

## Credit
While the whole project didn't start from a template, I did implement some pretty cool things from a template called [Agency](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/). It's a pretty sleek website. The main things that I took from it are the javascript features that it includes. You might also notice a slight design skew towards their design, but I tried not to let it look too much like their template.
